    <h1>My Proposal For WebTech Project</h1>

    <h3>What is your website about?</h3>
    <p>
      I am planning to make a website about skiing in Switzerland. Within
      Switzerland, there are dozens of different ski resorts. However,
      international travels often focus on a few big names such as St.Mortiz,
      Verbier, and Zermatt as they are not aware of the other hidden gems within
      Switzerland. Also, these Ski resorts offer very different experiences and
      different prices. Thus, I what to create an informational website that
      provides somewhat of an international guide to skiing in Switzerland that
      would cover the following topics for a variety of ski reports in
      Switzerland: Proximity To Airport, Ski Area Size, Ski Area Difficulty,
      Price, Snow Conditions, Experience, Popularity, and Countries Located
      Within the Ski Resort).
    </p>
    <h3>What is the objective of your website?</h3>
    <p>
      The objective is to have an informative website that helps people/groups
      decide which Ski Area to go to when booking a trip to Switzerland. I will
      hopefully have a comment section for each ski resort so that individuals
      can provide their own experience of the ski locations.
    </p>
    <h3>Who is your target audience?</h3>
    <p>
      Families, groups, and Individuals looking to go on a Skiing holiday in
      Switzerland are unsure of where to go or want to try a new Ski Area maybe.
    </p>
    <h3>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h3>
    <p>
      I plan to look at the Top 10 ski destinations in Switzerland, and I will
      have a summary page and a breakdown of each location on a new page. I will
      also have a comments page where users can engage. I also plan to have a
      blog page about me that follows my latest skiing adventures and includes
      somewhat a photo gallery showing some of my favorite skiing photos.
